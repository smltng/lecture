1. A given program spends 10% of its time in an initial startup phase, and then 90% of its time in work that can be easily parallelized. Assuming a machine with homogeneous cores, plot the idealized speedup and parallel efficiency of the overall code according to Amdahl’s law for up to 128 cores. If you know how, you should use a script to produce this plot, with both the serial fraction and the maximum number of cores as parameters.

2. Suppose a particular program can be partitioned into perfectly independent tasks, each of which takes time τ. Tasks are set up, scheduled, and communicated to p workers at a (serial) central server; this takes an overhead time α per task. What is the theoretically achievable throughput (tasks/time)?
The task uses weak scaling rather than strong scaling as the time varies _per task_. This means that we should use Gustafson's Law, so the scaling is:
p−α(p−1).

3. Under what circumstances is it best to not tune?
It's best not to tune when the costs outweigh the benefits--that is, if tuning takes more time and energy than it would to just run the code as is, then there's no point to tune.

4. The class cluster consists of eight nodes and fifteen Xeon Phi accelerator boards (details under the “Computing platform” section of the syllabus). Based on an online search for information on these systems, what do you think is the theoretical peak flop rate (double-precision floating point operations per second)? Show how you computed this, and give URLs for where you got the parameters in your calculation. (We will return to this question again after we cover some computer architecture.)

120 GF/s per core, 12 cores per node, 96 total cores.

1010.88*15+120*96 = 26,683 GF/s
